Creating middleware in Node.js is a fundamental concept, 
especially when building applications with frameworks like Express. 
Middleware allows you to inject custom logic into the request-response cycle. 
Let's walk through the steps to create a simple middleware application:

1. **Setting Up Your Project:**
   First, create a new folder for your project (if you haven't already).
   You can use the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Create a Basic Server:**
   Next, create a file (let's call it `server.js`) where you'll define your 
   server. In this example, we'll use Express, but you can adapt this to 
   other frameworks as well. Install Express if you haven't already:
   
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

3. **Defining Middleware:**
   Now, let's create a simple middleware that logs information about each 
   incoming request. In your `server.js` file, add the following code:
   
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Custom middleware: logs the request time
   const requestTimeMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
       req.requestTime = Date.now();
       console.log(`Request received at ${new Date(req.requestTime)}`);
       next(); // Move to the next middleware or route handler
   };

   // Use the middleware for all routes
   app.use(requestTimeMiddleware);

   // Define your routes here (e.g., app.get('/', ...))

   // Start the server
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
   In this example:
   - We create a middleware function called `requestTimeMiddleware`.
   - It adds a `requestTime` property to the `req` object, capturing the 
     timestamp when the request was received.
   - The `next()` function ensures that the request continues to the next 
     middleware or route handler.

4. **Using Your Middleware:**
   You can now use `req.requestTime` in your route handlers to access the 
   timestamp. For instance:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send(`Hello! Request received at ${new Date(req.requestTime)}`);
   });
   ```

5. **Test Your Middleware:**
   Start your server (`node server.js`) and make requests to it. You'll see 
   the log messages indicating when each request was received.

Remember that middleware can be more complex than this‚Äîhandling 
authentication, error handling, or modifying request/response objects. 
But this simple example should give you a good starting point! üòä
