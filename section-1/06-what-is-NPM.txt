**npm** stands for **Node Package Manager**. It's a library and registry 
for JavaScript software packages. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Software Registry**: npm is the world's largest software registry, 
containing over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers use it to 
share software, and many organizations use it to manage private development.

2. **Package Manager**: npm allows you to easily install and manage 
dependencies for your Node.js projects. You can use npm commands to 
download and install different packages.

3. **Dependencies**: All npm packages are defined in files called 
`package.json`. This file specifies the project's dependencies 
(other packages it relies on). You can manage these dependencies using npm.

4. **Free to Use**: npm is free, and you can download public software 
packages without any registration or login.

5. **Installation**: npm comes bundled with Node.js. To use npm, you need 
to install Node.js first. You can download Node.js from the official website.

6. **Publishing Your Own Packages**: If you want to share your own software 
on the npm registry, you can sign in at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com). 
Once logged in, you can publish your project using the `npm publish` command.

Remember, npm simplifies package management and makes it easy to collaborate 
with other developers! ðŸš€

TIPS(in TERMINAL)
1, To create package.json file - npm init
2, To create package.json file with default values - npm init -y
3, to install npm package from a public repo- npm install packageName
4, npm install packageName -save : for runtime 
5, npm install packageName --save-dev : for development development phase
6, npm uninstall packageName -D packageName : for development development phase
7, npm install packageName : also for runtime  and installs only on project
8, npm install packageName -g: to install globally on machine
9, npm uninstall -g packageName: to uninstall globally on machine
10, npm root -g : to locate global dependencies folder 

note:
Dependencies: These are modules that are required at runtime
devDependencies: These are modules that are required at development phase.
