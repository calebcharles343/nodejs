Certainly! **Express.js** is a minimal and flexible **Node.js** web 
application framework that provides a robust set of features for building 
web and mobile applications. Here are some key points about Express:

1. **Features**:
   - **Fast and Unopinionated**: Express is designed to be lightweight and 
     unopinionated, allowing developers to make their own choices regarding 
     architecture and tools.
   - **Routing**: Express provides a simple and flexible routing system for 
     handling different HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
   - **Middleware**: Middleware functions can be used to process requests 
     before they reach the route handler. This allows for tasks like 
     authentication, logging, and error handling.
   - **Template Engines**: Express supports various template engines 
     (such as EJS, Pug, and Handlebars) for rendering dynamic content.
   - **Static File Serving**: Easily serve static files (CSS, images, etc.) 
     using built-in middleware.
   - **RESTful APIs**: Express is commonly used for building RESTful APIs 
     due to its simplicity and flexibility.

2. **Installation**:
   - You can install Express using npm (Node Package Manager):
     ```bash
     $ npm install express --save
     ```

3. **Example**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Express!');
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server started on port 3000');
   });
   ```
