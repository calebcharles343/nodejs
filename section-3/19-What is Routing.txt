**Routing in Node.js** refers to determining how an application responds to 
client requests at specific endpoints (URLs). Essentially, it's about 
handling different routes or URLs within your application. Let's dive into 
the details:

1. **Routing Basics**:
   - **Endpoints**: In a web application, endpoints correspond to different 
       pages or functionalities. Each endpoint is identified by a URI 
       (Uniform Resource Identifier) or path and a specific HTTP request 
       method (e.g., GET, POST).
   - **Handler Functions**: When a client request matches an endpoint, a
       handler function is called to process the request and send an 
       appropriate response.

2. **Using Express Framework**:
   - **Express.js** is a popular Node.js framework that simplifies routing. 
       It provides an `app` object for defining routes.
   - For a **GET request**, you can use the `app.get()` method:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     
     app.get('/', function(req, res) {
         res.send('Hello, Sir!');
     });
     ```
   - For **POST requests**, use the `app.post()` method similarly.

3. **Routing Without Express**:
   - If you want to build your own server without dependencies, you can
     handle routing from scratch using Node.js built-in modules.
   - Example (without Express):
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');
     
     http.createServer(function (req, res) {
         const url = req.url;
         if (url === '/about') {
             res.write('Welcome to the About Us page');
             res.end();
         } else if (url === '/contact') {
             res.write('Welcome to the Contact Us page');
             res.end();
         } else {
             res.write('Hello, World!');
             res.end();
         }
     }).listen(3000, function () {
         console.log("Server started on port 3000");
     });
     ```
   - In this example, different URLs (`/about`, `/contact`, etc.) are
     handled based on the client's request.

Remember, routing allows your application to respond appropriately to
different paths and methods. Whether you use Express or build your own 
routing logic, it's a crucial part of web development! üöÄ
