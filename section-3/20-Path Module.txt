The **Node.js** `path` module provides utilities for working with file 
and directory paths. Here are some commonly used methods from the `path` 
module:

1. **`path.basename(path[, suffix])`**: Returns the last portion of a path 
   (the file name) from the given `path`. You can optionally provide a 
   `suffix` to remove from the file name.
2. **`path.dirname(path)`**: Returns the directory name of a `path`.
3. **`path.extname(path)`**: Returns the file extension (including the dot) 
   from the given `path`.
4. **`path.join([...paths])`**: Joins all given path segments into a single 
   path.
5. **`path.normalize(path)`**: Normalizes the given `path`, resolving any 
   `..` and `.` segments.
6. **`path.parse(path)`**: Parses a `path` into an object with properties 
   like `root`, `dir`, `base`, `name`, and `ext`.
7. **`path.resolve([...paths])`**: Resolves an absolute path from the given 
   path segments.
8. **`path.sep`**: A platform-specific path segment separator 
   (`/` on Unix-like systems, `\` on Windows).
9. **`path.isAbsolute(path)`**: Checks if the given `path` is an absolute 
   path.
10. **`path.toNamespacedPath(path)`**: Converts the given `path` to a 
   namespace-prefixed path (Windows only).
11. **`path.posix`**: An object providing POSIX-specific path methods.
12. **`path.win32`**: An object providing Windows-specific path methods.

To get the path of the currently executing script/module, you can use the
 `__dirname` global variable. It returns the directory path of the currently 
 executing script. For example:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const modulePath = path.join(__dirname, "models");
```

Remember to adjust the path using `../` if needed to reach the root of your 
module. If you're looking for the complete path to a specific module that 
you've loaded via `require`, you can use `require.resolve("moduleName")` 
to get the resolved filename¬≤¬≥. Additionally, if you've installed a module 
using npm, you can set the modules path directly in your JavaScript file‚Å¥. üöÄ
